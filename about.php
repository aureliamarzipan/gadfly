            <h2>We feel a desperate need to be irritating and perhaps recreate society</h2>
            <p>The Gadfly is the Student's alternative newspaper. 
                Published approximately once a semester, we cover events and issues ignored by the mainstream press and to highlight 
                alternative forms of expression such as poetry and visual art. The Gadfly serves a twofold purpose. 
                It is the bug that stirs debate and adds a substantive edge to discussion of issues, 
                while it is also a place for people to exercise their abilities at writing critical and 
                insightful pieces for a larger audience. The Gadfly takes the small group discussions, 
                the single issue struggles, and acts as an instrument for public dispersion of these discussions.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Gadfly originally ran as an alternative newspaper from 1985 to 1997 as a mouthpiece for activists on campus. 
                They published with regard to both University and Vermont issues as well as international struggles in the 80s and 90s. 
                In Spring of 2023, we, the Gadfly Collective, revived that old publication, revamping it into what you see today.
                If you'd like to view historic issues, they are available on the second floor of the Billings Library. We also ocassionaly re-publish selected articles from that time period.</p>
